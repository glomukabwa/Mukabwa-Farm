                        <h1>About Us</h1>
                        <p>Located in the fertile lands of Kakamega County, our farm was founded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">George Mukabwa</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mike Mukabwa</span>, two visionaries who shared one powerful mission — to transform their village from dependency to self-sufficiency by producing high-quality farm products that sustain livelihoods and empower the community.</p>
                        <p>For years, the village had been a sleeping giant — blessed with rich soil and favorable weather but untapped potential. While many waited for outside investors, George believed that progress begins with initiative. When he shared his idea with Mike, the vision immediately took root. The co-founder brought innovative strategies and a shared passion for community transformation. Together, they laid the foundation for what would become a thriving agricultural enterprise.</p>
                        <p>Guided by the words “<span style="font-style: italic;">a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step </span>,”they started small — with just a few cows producing milk. From these</p>

                    <div class="second">
                        <p>humble beginnings, the farm steadily expanded to include chicken, pigs, bulls, maize, and kales, growing into a diverse and sustainable source of income and nourishment for the community.</p>
                        <p>Like every success story, the journey was not without challenges. In the early days, the farm faced limited capital, unskilled labor, and poor access to agricultural expertise due to its remote village location. Yet, with determination, resilience, and a deep belief in the power of community, the two founders turned every obstacle into a stepping stone toward growth.</p>
                        <p>The farm has become a source of employment and inspiration for villagers, encouraging them to embrace agriculture as a sustainable way of life. Today, the farm stands as a symbol of what can be achieved when passion meets purpose — proving that even the smallest step, taken with conviction, can spark lasting change.</p>
                        <p>We continue to look ahead with optimism, seeking partnerships and innovations that will take our vision further.</p>
